After you set it up, it'll cover all your home devices, and you won't need any client-side software for that. <p>Based on the official Image: <a href='https://hub.docker.com/r/adguard/adguardhome' target='_blank'>https://hub.docker.com/r/adguard/adguardhome</a>, available for amd64 and arm64 architecture.</p> <p>Create a macvlan to avoid overlapping of ports which are needed by Adguard like 443 & 80. E.g., <code>docker network create -d macvlan --subnet=192.168.178.0/24 --ip-range=192.168.178.58/32 --gateway=192.168.178.1 -o parent=eth0 adguard-home</code></p><p>The docker network has to be named <code>adguard-home</code>!</p> <p>For the initial setup the UI is reachable under the IP-Adress defined in the macvlan. E.g.: <code>192.168.178.58</code>. and the setup port <code>3000</code>, i.e.:  <code>http://192.168.178.58:3000</code>. Once setup is complete, the admin page can be reached using port <code>80</code> e.g.,<code>http://192.168.178.58:80</code>.</p>",
